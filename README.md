# 🌌 Blackhole-Attack  

# 📖 Overview  
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models to **detect black hole attractors** in astronomical data.  
We apply and compare the performance of multiple classification algorithms to identify potential black hole attractors from astrophysical features.  

Implemented Algorithms:  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 👥  
- Decision Trees (DT) 🌳  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) ➖  
- Random Forests (RF) 🌲
