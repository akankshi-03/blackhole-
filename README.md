# ðŸŒŒ Blackhole-Attack  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models to **detect black hole attractors** in astronomical data.  
We apply and compare the performance of multiple classification algorithms to identify potential black hole attractors from astrophysical features.  

Implemented Algorithms:  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ðŸ‘¥  
- Decision Trees (DT) ðŸŒ³  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) âž–  
- Random Forests (RF) ðŸŒ²
